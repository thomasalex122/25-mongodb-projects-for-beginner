## Getting Started

To start contributing, you need to set up the project on your local machine.

### Installation

1. **Fork the repository:**
   - Click the fork button at the top right of the repository page.

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/repo_name
   ```

### Setting Up Environment Variables

#### Backend

1. In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file and add the following:

   JWT_SECRET=secret_key
   EMAIL_USER=email_id
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=Your_email_password
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

   - You can set up `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` using Gmail API or leave it if you don't want to work on the email feature.

#### Frontend

1. In the `quiz-maker` subdirectory, create a `.env` file and add the following:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Backend:**
   - To start the backend server, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - For development mode, you can use:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

2. **Frontend:**
   - Navigate to the `quiz-maker` subdirectory and start the frontend by running:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - If you encounter infinite loading, try clearing your browser's local storage for `localhost:3000`.
